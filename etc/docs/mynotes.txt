http -a admin:password :8080/resolutions
echo -n "New Resolution: TODO"  | http -a user:password :8080/resolution

% . ./token-for one user "resolution:read"
echo $TOKEN  #if you want to see it
http :8080/resolutions "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN"

need to request resolution:write, can I do multiple scopes?
